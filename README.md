# Welcome to vim4cpp

This vim plugin is all about making your C++ development much easier from auto header include guard, 
quick class definitions, default main configuartion and more.

I will first focus on the most core issues that stagnates productivity then I will work on secondary features 
that can serve as nice add-ons during development.

If you want to contribute, then please by all means do so! (I won't be hesitating pull requests unless absolutely neccessary.)

Please only clean code!
